    "# Fleur de Pain ReAct Agent — C4 Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Author: Ali Assaad\n",
    "### Course: EECE 503P — Fall 2026\n",
    "### Framework: LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom ReAct-style agent for the Fleur de Pain bakery built with a manual loop — Thought → Action → Observation → Answer (no prebuilt executors) — using LangGraph for state management. Supports multiple personas, integrates four operational tools, and includes experiments with LLM configurations and prompting strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario: Fleur de Pain bakery assistant\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals: Answer FAQs, enforce policies, collect leads, schedule pickups, process custom cake orders\n",
    "\n",
    "Audience: Customers planning purchases\n",
    "\n",
    "Grounding: PDF and text business documents\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints: No invented prices; baked fresh every 3 hours; custom cakes need 24 h notice\n",
    "\n",
    "## Personas\n",
    "\n",
    "Friendly Advisor — warm, conversational guidance\n",
    "\n",
    "Strict Expert — policy-focused, precise answers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools (All 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "record_customer_interest — General lead capture → logs/leads.jsonl\n",
    "\n",
    "record_feedback — Unknown/unhandled questions → logs/feedback.jsonl\n",
    "\n",
    "schedule_pickup — Pickup appointments → logs/scheduled_pickups.jsonl\n",
    "\n",
    "create_cake_order — Custom cake orders → logs/cake_orders.jsonl\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluate different LLM configurations and prompting strategies within the same LangGraph state machine."

    "\n",
    "**Based on 24 experiments across 6 configurations and 4 scenarios**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.1 Which persona was most helpful or natural, and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer: Friendly Advisor (for customer service context)**\n",
    "\n",
    "After analyzing **24 experiment results** with quantitative data from `detailed_results.jsonl`, the **Friendly Advisor** persona emerged as more helpful and natural for Fleur de Pain's bakery customer service. Here's the evidence:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Quantitative Comparison:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Metric | Friendly Advisor | Strict Expert | Difference |\n",
    "|--------|-----------------|---------------|------------|\n",
    "| **Avg Response Length** | ~280 characters | ~150 characters | 47% shorter (Strict) |\n",
    "| **Customer Warmth** | High | Low | Qualitative |\n",
    "| **Tool Calls (24 tests)** | 4 calls | 5 calls | Friendly uses better judgment |\n",
    "| **Policy Adherence** | 100% | 100% | Tie |\n",
    "| **Response Speed** | Slower | Faster | Strict wins |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why Friendly Advisor Won:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Warmth & Approachability** - Essential for hospitality business\n",
    "   - Example (Custom Cake): *\"I'd love to help with your custom cake! Just so you know...\"* (333 chars)\n",
    "   - vs. Strict: *\"Custom cakes require 24-hour minimum notice per bakery policy.\"* (184 chars)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Better Tool Judgment** - Fewer unnecessary tool calls\n",
    "   - Friendly: Tried to answer from documents first, called tools only when truly needed\n",
    "   - Strict: More aggressive logging, even for answerable questions\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Flexible Policy Enforcement** - Still firm but customer-centric\n",
    "   - Friendly: \"we typically need 24 hours' notice... let me take your details and our team will reach out to see if we can make it work\"\n",
    "   - Strict: \"require 24-hour minimum notice per bakery policy. Team will assess if exception possible.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Natural Conversation Flow** - Felt like talking to a real person\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **When Strict Expert Would Be Better:**\n",
    "- High-volume automated triage systems\n",
    "- Internal policy enforcement dashboards\n",
    "- Scenarios where brevity is critical (SMS, character limits)\n",
    "- Back-office automation vs. customer-facing\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.2 Which prompt and configuration worked best for this use case, and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Configuration: Friendly Advisor, Temperature 0.7, Top-p 1.0, GPT-4o**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Temperature Impact Analysis (Actual Examples):**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario: \"What breads are fresh now? When is the next batch?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Temp | Response | Observation |\n",
    "|------|----------|-------------|\n",
    "| **0.2** | \"We have a Bake Times board in our bakery that updates throughout the day... Feel free to check it out when you visit\" | Too rigid, feels scripted |\n",
    "| **0.7** | \"We bake fresh batches of bread every 3 hours, ensuring you always get the freshest loaves. While I don't have real-time details...\" | Natural, informative, balanced |\n",
    "| **1.0** | \"Great question! We update our 'Bake Times' board regularly throughout the day, showing which breads are fresh...\" | More creative phrasing, still accurate |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Finding:** Temperature 0.7 provided the **sweet spot** for:\n",
    "- Natural language variation (not robotic)\n",
    "- Policy adherence (no hallucinated details)\n",
    "- Consistent ReAct format following\n",
    "- Warm but professional tone\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why This Configuration?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Temperature 0.7:** \n",
    "   - Not too deterministic (0.2 feels robotic)\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **Challenge 1: Parsing Action Calls Reliably**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** LLMs don't always format tool calls exactly as specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples of failures:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Expected:\n",
    "Action: record_feedback({\"question\": \"Do you have gluten-free?\"})\n",

    "- Built regex-based parser: `r'Action:\\s*(\\w+)\\s*\\((.*?)\\)'`\n",
    "- Error handling with graceful fallback\n",
    "- Feed parsing errors back to LLM as Observation\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **1. Few-Shot Examples Are Critical**\n",
    "\n",
    "Including 2-3 concrete examples in system prompt **dramatically** improved format adherence:\n",
    "- Without examples: ~70% format success\n",
    "- With examples: ~95% format success\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lesson:** Don't just tell the LLM what to do - show it exactly how.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Temperature Tuning Is Use-Case Specific**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Use Case | Recommended Temp | Why |\n",
    "|----------|-----------------|-----|\n",
    "| Customer Service | 0.7 | Natural conversation + consistency |\n",
    "| Policy Enforcement | 0.2-0.3 | Strict adherence, no creativity |\n",
    "| Data Extraction | 0.2 | Deterministic, factual |\n",
    "| Creative Writing | 0.8-1.0 | Variation, personality |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lesson:** Don't use default temperature - experiment and measure!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Error Handling Is Essential**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reality:** Tool execution WILL fail. Plan for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = self._execute_tool(tool_name, tool_args)\n",
    "    observation = {\"status\": \"success\", \"result\": result}\n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "    observation = {\"status\": \"error\", \"message\": str(e)}\n",
    "```\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Manual Loops Offer Superior Control**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prebuilt Executors:**\n",
    "- ✅ Fast to implement\n",
    "- ❌ Black box behavior\n",
    "- ❌ Hard to debug\n",
    "- ❌ Limited customization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Manual Loops:**\n",
    "- ✅ Full control over reasoning steps\n",
    "- ✅ Custom stopping logic\n",
    "- ✅ Easy debugging (inspect messages)\n",
    "- ✅ Domain-specific optimizations\n",
    "- ❌ More code to maintain\n",

    "**Lesson:** For production systems, manual loops worth the effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Business Context Size Matters**\n",
    "\n",

    "**Observations:**\n",
    "- ✅ Fast retrieval\n",
    "- ✅ Always available\n",
    "- ✅ No vector DB needed\n",
    "\n",
    "**But:** Wouldn't scale to 100+ page documentation\n",

    "#### **Why LangGraph Was The Right Choice:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lightweight & Flexible** - Didn't force prebuilt patterns\n",
    "2. **State Management** - Handled message history cleanly\n",
    "3. **Custom Loop Compatible** - Allowed our manual ReAct controller\n",
    "4. **Easy Debugging** - Could visualize state transitions\n",
    "5. **Production Ready** - Built-in checkpointing, streaming, error handling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative frameworks considered:**\n",
    "- ❌ LangChain Agents: Too opinionated, forced prebuilt executors\n",
    "- ❌ Raw OpenAI: No state management, would need to build from scratch\n",

    "3. **Monitor:** Tool call success rate, response times, customer satisfaction\n",
    "4. **A/B Test:** Friendly vs. Strict on real customer subset\n",
    "5. **Expand:** Add more tools (check_inventory, calculate_price, find_location)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cost Estimate (GPT-4o):**\n",
    "- Avg prompt: ~2,000 tokens (context + messages)\n",
    "- Avg completion: ~100 tokens (response + tool calls)\n",
