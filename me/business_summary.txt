Fleur de Pain Summary

Fleur de Pain bakes fresh, honest bread and pastries using slow fermentation, natural ingredients, and zero preservatives. Artisan loaves (baguette, country sourdough, multigrain, ciabatta, brioche, rye) and viennoiserie (croissant, pain au chocolat, cinnamon roll, danish, éclairs) are turned out in fresh batches every 3 hours, alongside cakes and sweets—including customizable celebration cakes with just 24-hour notice. The menu is complemented by a coffee bar (espresso, filter, hot chocolate) and catering options such as breakfast boxes, mini-pastry trays, and dessert tables.

Operations are led by Head Baker Leila Haddad and Pastry Chef Karim Mansour, with GM Maya Rahme and Bakery Manager Zainab Barakat coordinating day-to-day service, hygiene, and KPIs. Production and service are supported by Assistant Bakers Samir Karam and Ranya Boutros, Cake Decorator Farah Nassar, Barista Lead Jad Abou Khalil, FOH Supervisor Noelle Fares, FOH Associate Rami Choueiri, Cashier Layal Hamdan, Delivery & Logistics Tarek Chams, Procurement & Inventory Hiba Zaiter, and Marketing & Digital Ahmad Eid.

The value proposition centers on freshness (no day-old bread sold as “fresh”), transparency via an all-day Bake Times board, and quality-first ingredients (natural starters, locally milled flours, real butter, no premixes). Customization is straightforward through a form-based cake builder with clear pricing tiers, while convenience comes from pre-order, pickup, or delivery with 2-hour windows and optional bread subscriptions. Ordering: open daily; pre-order via WhatsApp; same-day pickup while stocks last; custom cakes need 24 hours.
